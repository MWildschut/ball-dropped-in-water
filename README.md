# ball-dropped-in-water
Mariza Wildschut 5762944
This project will simulate how a ball with a certain volume and mass will react when dropped in water from a certain height and with a certain starting speed. The result of this simulation will be visualised. 
The calculations for this project will be done using numpy, and the visualisation will be done using plotly or matplot. 
The input of the code will consist of the mass of the ball, the radius of the ball, the initial position of the ball, and the intial velocity of the ball in the vertical and horizontal direction. 
The code will generate an animation of the trajectory that the ball takes.
