# ball-dropped-in-box
Mariza Wildschut 5762944
This project will simulate 2 balls of the same mass when dropped in a box.  
The code will calculate how the balls interact with eachother and with the walls, the floor and the ceiling. It will not take friction in account and it will assume completely elastic collision. 
The calculations for this project will be done using numpy, and the visualisation will be done using matplotlib. The simulation will run for 10 seconds. 
The input of the code will consist of the initial position and the initial speeds of the balls in the x and y direction, with optional inputs for the radius of the balls and the locations of the walls, floor and ceiling. 
The code will generate an animation of the trajectory that the balls take.
